# #giveit100 - 100 Days of JavaScript

There is a lot to know in the world of JavaScript in 2017. 

I have no interest nor intention in knowing all of it, however, I do want to once more immerse myself in the world of coding and re-discover the excitement that comes with finding new ways to approach problems. 

To this end, I am embarking on a #giveit100 adventure to carve out time to learn more about my favorite programming language, JavaScript. These adventures will include watching a long backlog of conference talks, reading blog posts and taking workshops and tutorials that I've been wanting to enjoy. Perhaps I'll even get to see what all the hype is about with this "React" folks are so excited about!

Along the way, I'll be chronicalling the things I'll be watching, learning, reading and coding to help with deeper learning for myself now and as a reference for furture me. In doing this, hopefully others will also be able to discover some great resources for learning.

In short, each work day for the next 100 days I am be committing to learning and documenting one newly learned or relearned thing about JavaScript. I'll be keeping my notes as a README for each day in a folder within this repo.

Happy coding!
